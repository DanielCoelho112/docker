problems using docker:   when the container, ex: nodejs, is getting full capacity, we just need to create other container: docker run nodejs
                         you have to watch the containers, because if the container fails, YOU have to run another container
                         if the docker host crash, the containers running on that host became inaccessible

solution1:                hiring an engineer just to watch this, and fix it needed


solution1:  ORCHESTRATION:      set of scripts that maintain the containers on a stage of production
                                tipically consist in a lot of docker host, so if one fail the other get up
                                this can scale up the number of instances of a container when the users get up, and decrease if the users decrease


                                Types of ORCHESTRATION:     
                                                            Docker Swarm   (easy to set up to start but lacks a lot features)
                                                            Kubernetes      (moderate to set up to start but has a lot features)  (BEST)
                                                            Mesos
