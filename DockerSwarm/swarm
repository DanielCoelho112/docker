you can have a lot of docker host

Set up:
        you have to have machines with docker installed
        you have to choose one machine to be the swarm manager, and the others the workers

        then:  --docker swarm init, and then copy a link and give to the others for they join the docker swarm


--docker run my-web-server, creates the container in your docker host

(on the swarm manager)
-- docker service create --replicas=3 my-web-server, create 3 instances of the container across the workers
